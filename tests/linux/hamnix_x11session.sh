# THIS tree. Xwayland is an X server that is itself a Wayland client, so it
# connects there and every X11 program in here -- including Steam, whose UI is
# X11-only CEF -- gets a screen without anything knowing about wsys.

#   -shm     the pure-pixman screen. The default glamor path wants GL on the
#            Wayland side and there is none.
#   -noreset the server would otherwise reset when its last client exits and
#            take the Wayland surface down with it.
