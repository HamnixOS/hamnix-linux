# QA bug list — 2026-07-01 (user interactive session, fresh reboot)

Source: user hands-on session on `build/hamnix-installer.img` (rebuilt 2026-07-01).
Orchestrator is primary bug-finder; this is the working list. Status markers:
`[ ]` open · `[~]` agent in flight · `[x]` fixed+verified.

## Clarifications from the user
- The **file browser** (`hamfm`) was the intended target of earlier "browser"
  talk. We *also* built a **native web browser** (`hambrowse`, Internet menu).
  A native browser is fine to keep, **but it must show in the menu**. Long-term
  web plan is unchanged: X11 pass-through in the Linux namespace → Firefox/Chromium.

## Cluster A — DE panel / widgets / context-menu / settings — LANDED da91cc38
Fixed in the live scene panel (`hampanelscene.ad`) + `hamsettings.ad`; note the
legacy `hampanel.ad`/`hamctxmenu.ad`/`hamappmenu.ad` are NOT what the scene DE
spawns. Regression gate: `scripts/test_de_panel_widgets_ux.sh` (PASS on main).
- [~] **A1 App/window list not live.** Wiring verified intact + kernel
  self-test `test_de_multiwin_taskbar` passes; NOT reproducible in current code.
  Hit-testing hardened. **NEEDS LIVE VERIFY** — if still seen, prime suspect is
  the kernel workspace filter (`wsys_win_ws[w]==wsys_cur_ws`) hiding windows
  after a pager switch (flagged, not blindly changed).
- [x] **A2 CPU widget** idle-100% — was load-avg*50 scaling; rewritten to
  /dev/uptime idle/total delta with first-sample guard → near-0% idle.
- [x] **A3 Right-click blank panel** now opens Add-a-widget (elastic tasks/
  spacer treated as blank; trailing hit-rect bound fixed).
- [x] **A4 Right-click Applications button** now shows Move/Remove like any widget.
- [x] **A5 Settings** edge selector keeps all 4 panels on distinct edges;
  add-widget chips moved to their own sub-column (overlap gone); classic look.
- [x] **A6 Web Browser** row added to the scene dropdown → /bin/hambrowse;
  file manager (/bin/hamfmscene) confirmed present.

## Cluster B — Install wizard — LANDED ec9a9ff7
- [x] **B1 Multi-page wizard** — 6-page Back/Next wizard (host name, install
  user, user pw+confirm, host-owner pw+confirm, partition, review). Inputs flow
  to target `/etc/{hostname,passwd,shadow}` via `install_file` ctl verb + `$6$`
  sha512_crypt. Auto path flag-gated (unchanged). Gate: `test_installer_wizard.sh`.
- [x] **B2 Partition manager** — target-disk picker + guided(default)/manual +
  ESP-size field; both drive the same GPT+ESP+ext4 path. OVMF/KVM install+boot
  verified.
  - FOLLOW-UP: per-user home file server + `.ns` recipe made on first boot, not
    at install time (offline-target limit).

## Cluster C — Identity
- [ ] **C1 `whoami` on the elevated shell says "nobody"** — should say **`live`**
  (the live image's username). Elevated-shell identity not propagated.

## Cluster D — Performance
- [x] **D1 First-terminal input lag** — LANDED b9744841. Root cause traced:
  cross-process file-read caching (ext4 page cache + block buffer cache) cold on
  the first `hamsh`/rc/`ls`/`pwd` reads; warm for terminal #2. Fix: rc.5
  pre-warms the caches synchronously before the terminal launches; `pwd` is now
  a hamsh builtin (no `/bin/pwd` cold-exec); `COLD_START` marker added. Gate:
  `test_de_first_term_prewarm_guard.sh` PASS. **DEFERRED live-timing validation**
  (quiet window): boot DE, read `COLD_START jiffies` before/after — tracked below.
- [~] **D2/D3 REFRAMED — not startup latency, an SMP wedge** (agent ad63d2b,
  measured on the real live image). On `-smp 1` both are sub-second
  (`newshell hostowner` +0.4s, `enter linux` +0.4s cold). On `-smp>1` the whole
  system stalls/wedges during the runlevel-5 fork+exec app-launch storm →
  presents as the user's 30–60s (D3) / ~2s (D2). Two factors: (1) LAPIC timer
  miscalibration under KVM (PIT-anchored, jiffies ~18–30× too fast → IRQ storm);
  (2) a scheduler/IPC deadlock exposed by the concurrent fork+exec storm.
  `_execve_lock` (f404c73c) RULED OUT. **Fix tracked as task #7** (timer
  re-anchor to TSC/HPET first; deadlock is a separate follow-up). CI gap: no
  test boots the full DE image under `-smp>1` — add one.
  - Incidental (confirmed): the live SERIAL console already runs as `live`
    (uid 1001); only the DE terminal is `nobody` — see C1.

## Notes
- Perf theme continues the long-standing DE input-latency track (see memory
  `project_de_perf_pivot`, `project_de_interactive_broken_2026-06-15`).
